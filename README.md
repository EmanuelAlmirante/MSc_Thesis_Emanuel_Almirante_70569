Implementation of the project of my thesis.

Read the PDF inside 'Thesis PDF' for a better understanding of what is requested to be done.

Always comment the code.

Right now, the client connects to the server and the server gives him a random ID. Also, the video is downloaded and shown to the client.

Next tasks to be done:

* Do the P2P part, so that the video is download from the server only by one client and the other clients download it through P2P.

* Peers can stream video to each other. Need to make the list of streams available.
