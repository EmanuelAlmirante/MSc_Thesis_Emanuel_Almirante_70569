Implementation of the project of my thesis.

Always comment the code.

Right now, the client connects to the server and the server gives him a random ID. Also, the video is downloaded and shown to the client.

Next tasks to be done:

* Make the client's IP appear to the client (not very important).

* Program the Peer Coordinator, so that the P2P part can be done.

* Do the P2P part, so that the video is download from the server only by one clien and the other clients download it through P2P.

* Make the peers able to colaborate with content and that content is shown to the other peers.
